      <p>I have been trying to think of a good topic to start my essays on here and I think a good way to start would be a reflection on the past year and maybe as I am reflecting I will come across some interesting topics to investigate for me and for anyone who ends up reading this (if anyone does).
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Consistency</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      This past year I ran 4,624.7 miles. It’s the most mileage I have ever done in a year by a monstrous margin. I averaged about 12.6 miles per day for an entire year and I am proud of that number. For a full year, I did not have any major injuries that prevented me from running and that brings me to the first idea that I want to talk about. Consistency. I was listening to a podcast the other day with Steve Magness (not a huge fan but he's pretty cool) and he talked about one of his athletes that had not been injured for 6 months and Steve knew that he was going to have an amazing indoor season and that's exactly what happened. The athlete improved a lot after he was able to string together a bunch of good days. Notice how I did not say great days. The days were just good. There is a lot of room for this topic of consistency to be explored in science. Consistency has not been studied much by physiologists because it is difficult to hold an experiment that lasts years and years and years. However, there is one exception that I am aware of and that is Stephen Seiler an exercise physiologist who studies endurance athletes for long periods. Stephen's work deserves it's own post though so I won't lump it in here. The point I am trying to make is that there is room for physiologists to explore how consistency affects an athlete's performance.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>physiology is complex</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      In May of 2019, I dedicated myself to trying to learn as much about running as I possibly could. I immediately realized that I knew very little about physiology and very little about science in general. But after a couple of days of reading, I felt that I had a pretty good grasp on what I needed to know for running. I was confident in my new-found knowledge. I was WRONG. I did not know anything. It was the Dunning-Kruger effect, I had gained some knowledge and my confidence accelerated upwards. Luckily I didn't make a fool of myself to too many people before I realized that I didn't know anything. I kept reading books about physiology and training philosophies and the knowledge that I gained has improved my performances. For example, if I hadn't dedicated myself to learning in May it is very doubtful that I would have won the indoor 5k in February. There were a lot of things that had to come together for that race, part of it was luck, but part of it was a precise attack that I felt gave me the best shot at winning. While physiology has progressed rapidly over the past few decades, training is still relatively new and there's a lot that science doesn't tell us about running. Physiology is complicated and we should remember that we do not know everything. It is for this reason that I now cringe when I hear running cliches like "keep your easy days easy", "follow the 150 heart rate rule", "just run high mileage", or something like that. These cliches oversimplify physiology and ignore the individual. In my opinion, it is really bad advice and in some cases just flat out wrong.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Self-centered</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      The individual is important. After realizing that I knew little about running I decided to focus on improving myself.
      "If you can not bring peace to your household how dare you try to rule a city!"
      It might sound a little selfish to focus on myself when cross country is a team sport but I figured that the best thing for the team would be for me to improve myself. It was the right kind of selfishness. I think that by focusing on myself I was able to place well at regionals and have faith in the rest of my teammates. I think it is really important for athletes to focus on what they can improve individually and that will lead to improvements in the team. It's not as simple as that, there is a place for captains and leaders on a team but I think we should be very careful in the advice we give. I might be completely wrong in suggesting that the individual should be the main focus but I think it is an interesting topic that could be explored more.
      <br>
      <br>
      That's what I am really after with these essays. I want to find a problem, explore the problem, organize my ideas, and hopefully get a little closer to a solution. So in this post, I talked about consistency, the complexity of physiology, and the individual. From these three topics, I think I would like to look more into the complexity of physiology and how it is oversimplified. I think I would learn a lot from exploring that idea.
      <br>
      <br>
      I underestimated how much I could write about this past year. I only mentioned cross country and a little bit of indoor track. I didn't even get to talk about COVID Season, and I learned a lot during that time. Maybe my next post will be about what I have done this spring.

I decided to start this website a couple of days ago because I realized that I wasn’t really doing anything with my life. My day would start with a run and end with a run but in between I was just wasting time watching videos on youtube, TikTok, or scrolling through Twitter. I was training pretty hard but other than that I wasn’t doing anything. I settled on the idea of making a website because I thought it would be good practice before I start my job in a couple weeks and because I would be able to integrate it with running. At first I was planning on writing a blog or just talking about my training but I think I am going to call them essays instead. These essays will be an attempt to explore a topic or answer a question related to running. An essay is an attempt. My hope is that through writing essays I will be able to organize my ideas and help spread information.
<br>
<br>
Starting this summer I will be an assistant coach at Lancaster Catholic High School. I am looking forward to the season and hopefully getting some high schoolers interested in running. I had a meeting with the coaches a few weeks ago and an individual meeting with one of the athletes. I could see that he really wanted to improve but he just didn’t have the information on how to train. I think there are a lot of high school runners in this situation. They want to get better but they don’t know how. It’s for this reason that I am thinking of starting to coach some athletes individually. I am going to have to think through the logistics a little bit more but it is something that I would really like to do. I enjoy researching training philosophies and physiology. I think I would be able to apply a lot of those concepts to aspiring young runners.</p>
